# FAQ
## What is Open AT?
Open AT is supposed to be an open-source reimplementation of the famed Soarer's Converter software. It's currently in NOT ACTUALLY WORKING PLEASE DO NOT USE state.

## OK, but why do this if Soarer's exists?
I wanted to design a custom board without being tied to a Teensy, which necessetated writing the software completely from scratch. I don't have access to PJRC's bootloader, after all.

## Sounds great! How do I use it?
Please don't.
